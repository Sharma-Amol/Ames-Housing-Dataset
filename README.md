## Context
Feature engineering is the use of techniques that transform the raw data into a set of features that can be used to train machine learning models with the aim of improving the accuracy and performance of these models. It mainly involves:-
 * Dealing with outliers.
 * Dealing with missing data.
 * Dealing with categorical data.

The goal of this exercise is to perform Feature Engineering on Ames Housing Dataset which contains missing data and both numerical and categorical features.
